# Data preparation for use with KGX

## Preparing data files

KGX support various file formats but there are certain assumptions made while 
working with these files. 

These are especially true for TSV/CSV and JSON format for things like, 
- How information about nodes are represented
- How information about edges are represented

Please refer to the [KGX format specification](specification/kgx-format.md) for more information.
