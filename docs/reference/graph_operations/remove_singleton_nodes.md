# Remove Singleton Nodes

The Remove Singleton Nodes operation can be used to remove all nodes in the graph that
has a degree of `0`. i.e. they are not participating in any edges.

This operation is typically useful for pruning graphs with isolated nodes before
using them in machine learning workflows.
