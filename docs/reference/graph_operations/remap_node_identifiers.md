# Remap Node Identifier

The Remap Node Identifier operation can be utilized to remap the `id` field of nodes
in a graph.

The main entry point is the `kgx.graph_operations.remap_node_identifier` method that
takes an instance of `kgx.graph.base_graph.BaseGraph` along with a `category`, 
`alternative_property`, and `prefix` as arguments.
