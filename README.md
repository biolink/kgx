KGX (Knowledge Graph Exchange) is a Python library and set of command line utilities for exchanging
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) that conform to or are aligned to the [Biolink Model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/).

The core datamodel is a [Property Graph](https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-database/) (PG), represented
internally in Python using a [networkx MultiDiGraph model](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/classes/generated/networkx.MultiDiGraph.edges.html).

KGX allows conversion to and from:

 * RDF serializations (read/write) and SPARQL endpoints (read)
 * Neo4j endpoints (read) or Neo4j dumps (write)
 * CSV/TSV and JSON (see [associated data formats](./data-preparation.md) and [example script to load CSV/TSV to Neo4j](./examples/scripts/load_csv_to_neo4j.py))
 * Reasoner Standard API format
 * OBOGraph JSON format


KGX will also provide validation, to ensure the KGs are conformant to the Biolink Model: making sure nodes are
categorized using Biolink classes, edges are labeled using valid Biolink relationship types, and valid properties are used.

Internal representation is a property graph, specifically a networkx MultiDiGraph.

The structure of this graph is expected to conform to the Biolink Model standard, briefly summarized here:

 * [Nodes](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/NamedThing.html)
    * `id`: CURIE; required
    * `name`: string; recommended
    * `category`: string; broad high level type. Corresponds to node label in Neo4j
    * other properties 
 * [Edges](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/related_to.html)
    * `subject`: CURIE; required
    * `edge_label`: CURIE; required; Corresponds to edge label in Neo4j
    * `object`: CURIE, required
    * `relation`: CURIE; required
    * other properties


In addition to the main code-base, KGX also provides a series of [command line operations](https://kgx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#using-kgx-cli).


## Installation for Users

KGX is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/kgx/) and you can install KGX via `python pip`.

> **Note:** the installation of KGX requires Python 3.7+

```bash
pip install kgx
```


## Installation for Developers


### Python 3.7+ and Core Tool Dependencies

> **Note:** the installation of KGX requires Python 3.7+

You should first confirm what version of Python 
you have running and upgrade to v3.7 as necessary, following best practices of your operating system. 
It is also assumed that the common development tools are installed including git, pip, and all necessary
development libraries for your operating system.


### Getting the repository

Go to where you wish to host your local project repository and clone the repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/local/git/project/folder
git clone https://github.com/NCATS-Tangerine/kgx.git

# then enter into the cloned project repository
cd kgx
```


### Configuring a virtual environment for KGX

For convenience, make use of the Python `venv` module to create a lightweight virtual environment. 

> Note that you may also have to install the appropriate `venv` package for Python 3.7. 
> 
> For example, under Ubuntu Linux, you might 
> 
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install python3.7-venv  
> ```


Once `venv` is available, type:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```


### Installing Python Dependencies 

The Python dependencies of the application need to be installed into the local environment using a version
of `pip` matched to your Python 3.7+ installation (assumed here to be called `pip3`).

> Again, follow the specific directives of your operating system for the installation.
> 
> For example, under Ubuntu Linux, to install the Python 3.7 matched version of pip, type the following:
> 
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install python3-pip
> ```
> 
> which will install the `pip3` command.

At this point, it is advisable to separately install the `wheel` package dependency before proceeding further 
(Note: it is  assumed here that your `venv` is activated)


```bash
pip3 install wheel
```
 
After installation of the `wheel` package, install KGX:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To install KGX,

```bash
python3 setup.py install
```

To test installation was successful, run the following:
```bash
kgx --help
```

which invokes the KGX CLI tool.
