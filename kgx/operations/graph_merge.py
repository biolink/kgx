def merge_all_graphs(graphs: List[BaseGraph], preserve: bool = True) -> BaseGraph:
    """
    Merge one or more graphs.

    .. note::
        This method will first pick the largest graph in ``graphs`` and use that
        as the target to merge the remaining graphs. This is to reduce the memory
        footprint for this operation. The criteria for largest graph is the graph
        with the largest number of edges.

        The caveat is that the merge operation has a side effect where the largest
        graph is altered.

        If you would like to ensure that all incoming graphs remain as-is, then
        look at ``merge_graphs``.

    The outcome of the merge on node and edge properties depend on the ``preserve`` parameter.
    If preserve is ``True`` then,
    - core properties will not be overwritten
    - other properties will be concatenated to a list

    If preserve is ``False`` then,
    - core properties will not be overwritten
    - other properties will be replaced

    Parameters
    ----------
    graphs: List[kgx.graph.base_graph.BaseGraph]
        A list of instances of BaseGraph to merge
    preserve: bool
        Whether or not to preserve conflicting properties
