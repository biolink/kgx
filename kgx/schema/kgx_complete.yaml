          noting unexpected effects from existing treatments, or the creation of new
          technology that allows novel ways of targeting medical products to sites

          to change anything about the drug formulation or approve it for a new use,
          they must apply with the FDA. The FDA also frequently reviews the drug’s

          is used to determine the safety and dosage of the drug, and about 70% of

          the drug supposes to treat. This phase can last from a few months to two
          years, and its purpose is to monitor the efficacy of the drug, as well as
          note side effects that may occur.

          it goes on to FDA review.

        description: Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development,

          unmet medical need. The purpose is to get important new drugs to the patient
          earlier. Fast Track addresses a broad range of serious conditions. For more

      fda_accelerated_approval:
        text: fda_accelerated_approval
        description: When studying a new drug, it can sometimes take many years to
          learn whether a drug actually provides a real effect on how a patient survives,
          feels, or functions. A positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful
          in the context of a given disease is known as “clinical benefit”. Mindful
          of the fact that it may take an extended period of time to measure a drug’s
          intended clinical benefit, in 1992 FDA instituted the Accelerated Approval
          regulations. These regulations allowed drugs for serious conditions that
          filled an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint.
          Using a surrogate endpoint enabled the FDA to approve these drugs faster.

      fda_priority_review:
        text: fda_priority_review
        description: Prior to approval, each drug marketed in the United States must
          go through a detailed FDA review process. In 1992, under the Prescription
          Drug User Act (PDUFA), FDA agreed to specific goals for improving the drug
          review time and created a two-tiered system of review times – Standard Review
          and Priority Review. A Priority Review designation means FDA’s goal is to
          take action on an application within 6 months (compared to 10 months under
          standard review). For more information https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/priority-review

        description: 'Biolink ''pre_clinical_research'' is the union of both the `FDA
          discovery and development phase` and `FDA preclinical research phase`. Discovery
          involves researchers finding new possibilities for medication through testing
          molecular compounds, noting unexpected effects from existing treatments,
          or the creation of new technology that allows novel ways of targeting medical
          products to sites in the body. Drug development occurs after researchers
          identify potential compounds for experiments Preclinical Research Phase.
          Once researchers have examined the possibilities a new drug may contain,
          they must do preliminary research to determine its potential for harm (toxicity).
          This is categorized as preclinical research and can be one of two types:
          in vitro or in vivo.'

          in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse event,
          inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a
          persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability
          to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
          Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening,
          or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate
          medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require
          medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in
          this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm
          requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias

          a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which
          means any adverse event caused by a drug.

          listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an
          investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with
          the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere
          in the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition,
          hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if
          the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
          Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected
          (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only
          cerebral vascular accidents. 'Unexpected', as used in this definition, also
          refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned
          in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated
          from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically
          mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

        description: An automated agent, typically a software program or tool, that
          is  responsible for generating a statement of knowledge. Human contribution  to
          the knowledge creation process ends with the definition and coding of algorithms
          or analysis pipelines that get executed by the automated agent.
      data_analysis_pipeline:
        text: data_analysis_pipeline
        description: An automated agent that executes an analysis workflow over data
          and  reports the direct results of the analysis. These typically report  statistical
          associations/correlations between variables in the input dataset, and do
          not interpret/infer broader conclusions from associations the analysis reveals
          in the data.
        is_a: automated_agent
        notes:
        - If an analysis pipeline includes any rules for generating broader  conclusions
          based on the dataset-specific statistical correlations it calculates (e.g.
          create a 'treats' edge when the analysis reveals a  drug-disease correlation
          in the data with statistical scores that meet a  certain threshold) - we
          would consider this agent to be a Computational Model rather than just a
          Data Analysis Pipeline.
      computational_model:
        text: computational_model
        description: An automated agent that generates knowledge statements (typically
          predictions) based on rules/logic explicitly encoded in an algorithm (e.g.
          heuristic models, supervised classifiers), or learned from patterns  observed
          in data (e.g. ML models, unsupervised classifiers).
        is_a: automated_agent
        notes:
        - The bar is quite low relatively for what is considered to be a  ‘computational
          model’ by our definition. Even agents/tools that apply  simple rules or
          logic to the output of an ingest or analysis pipeline to allow for a stronger
          or more general conclusion to be stated can  qualify an agent as a model.
          For example, an ingest pipeline that applies rules to its ingest of  clinical
          trials data to create a 'treats' prediction edge when the  source reports
          a drug to be in phase 2 or 3 trials represents a computational model because
          it is automatically drawing a stronger conclusion than the source reports,
          based on logic encoded in the ingest pipeline. Similarly, a data analysis
          pipeline that is extended with rules to  automatically generate broader
          conclusions based on dataset-specific statistical correlations (e.g. create
          a 'treats' edge when the analysis reveals a drug-disease correlation in
          the data with statistical scores  that meet a certain threshold), would
          also qualify as a computational  model by our definition.

          semantics (e.g. as an edge in a knowledge graph).
        is_a: automated_agent
        notes:
        - The original statement in the source text is typically made by a human /  manual
          agent, but if a specific encoding of this knowledge is produced by a text-mining
          tool, it has an agent_type of 'text_mining_agent'. Examples of text mining
          agents include SemmedDB, and the Translator Text-Mining Knowledge Provider.
          Note that text-mining tools are prone to erroneous interpretation of  concepts
          and relationships, and can fail to provide important details  about the
          context in which the original knowledge was reported - so users should always
          consult the source text for a text-mined statement to assess its veracity

        notes:
        - This term applies when a human was only involved in evaluating the veracity
          of a knowledge statement that was generated by an automated agent. It is  important
          to indicate when such manual review has occurred, because it can give a

        notes:
        - Knowledge Assertions are supported by direct evidence deemed sufficient

        notes:
        - These statements report entailed conclusions derived through dedictive inference.
          They are not directly asserted by a source, but logically follow from statement(s)  a
          source does make - and are necessarily true if their supporting premises
          are true.  In practice, these will primarily be entailments based on logic
          encoded in ontologies.  Examples include propagation of annotated knowledge
          to hierarchically-related concepts, across paths through a graph constructed
          from transitive relationships, or sets of  relationships that support property
          chain inference.

        notes:
        - Predictions typically result from non-deductive forms of reasoning - e.g.
          inductive and deductive inference, or statistical inference where conclusions
          are drawn about a broader/global population based on data from a representative
          cohort. For example, a prediction that a drug may treat a particular disease
          based on its chemical similarity to known drugs that treat the disease,
          and the fact that it can inhibit proteins  in a pathway that is associated
          with the disease As Predictions are based on weaker forms of inference and
          evidence, they are typically  considered lower confidence statements as
          compared to Knowledge Assertions and Logical Entailments.

      statistical_association:

        description: A statement that reports concepts representing variables in a

          (e.g. 'Metformin Treatment (variable 1) is correlated with Diabetes Diagnosis
          (variable 2) in EHR dataset X').
        notes:
        - Such statements report the direct results of some statistical analysis.
          Their scope is limited tp the cohort/dataset interrogated in the analysis,
          and they do not make broader claims or draw  more meaningful conclusions
          about the domain of discourse. Note however that such Statistical  Associations
          can be used as evidence to support a more pointed/precise Prediction or
          Assertion  of knowledge. For example, e.g. a Statistical Association between
          'Metformin Prescription' and 'Diabetes Diagnosis' in EHR records could support
          a Prediction that 'Metformin treats Diabetes',  or 'Metformin causes Diabetes'.
          This 'treats' edge may have a knowledge_level of 'Prediction',  but the
          provider could use the 'evidence_type' edge property to indicate that this
          prediction is  based on a 'Statistical Association'. Because Statistical
          Associations directly report analysis-specific  results, we can consider
          them to be inherently true statements, whose broader utility is dependent
          on  subsequent generalization of the reported result to a broader population,
          and/or interpretation of the  result as support for a more meaningful statements
          about the domain of discourse.

          inference.
        notes:
        - An observation that "56362 people self-reported taking melatonin to treat
          migraines" is agnostic to whether melatonin is an effective or approved
          treatment - it only claims that it was taken for this purpose. Such observations,
          however, may be used as the basis for predicting that a  drug may be efficacious
          against a disease.

        notes:

          they extract (e.g. whether the author  was predicting or asserting a relationship,

      example, for the GO concept of endocytosis (GO:0006897), use bl:BiologicalProcess
      as the type.
    comments:
    - This is modeled as a mixin. 'ontology class' should not be the primary type
      of a node in the KG. Instead you should use an informative bioloink category,
      such as AnatomicalEntity (for Uberon classes), ChemicalSubstance (for CHEBI
      or CHEMBL), etc
    - Note that formally this is a metaclass. Instances of this class are instances
      in the graph, but can be the object of 'type' edges. For example, if we had
      a node in the graph representing a specific brain of a specific patient (e.g
      brain001), this could have a category of bl:Sample, and by typed more specifically
      with an ontology class UBERON:nnn, which has as category bl:AnatomicalEntity
